- Unit and Integration Tests. Need more tests.

- Split(Reverse Split). For now just remove the stock from the list on Split(Reverse Split) day and 
	update the price coordinates accordingly. 
	
	In case of Split you can also make MaxActiveBuy to zero 
	so that system will not BUY any more stocks of the corresponding stock item.

	One other option in case of Split is to set a different price coordinate for each stock and adjust the
	price coordinate in such a way that the system will not BUY stocks at a much lower price.

	You have to keep track which stocks you own are going to Split(Reverse Split) in the next week. 
	I would check every Sunday and Wednesday evening. 
	Just pick 2 or 3 websites and keep monitoring twice a week. 
	Even though it's not 100% reliable because some websites don't promptly update this 
	information, we can still automate this.

	Example site where you can monitor Split(Reverse Split) activities.

- Commission. Right now BUY/SELL commission is zero. If commission changes, need to update the 
	ETradeSettings.py. It works!!!

	Good to have in future - Need storage mechanism to track commission changes/history. Also, we 
	should be able to figure out how much commision was charged for an executed BUY order.

- Error Notifications - For now errors are displayed in the terminal and stored in the log file.


- Information - If you cancel a partial filled order, fees will be charged for the entire order.
- Information - In extended hours trading, all orders will be cancelled at the end of the extended 
	hours trading session.
